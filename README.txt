Packet Sniffer

This project is a simple Python script that can be used to sniff network packets.
How to use

To use the script, simply run it with the interface name as an argument. For example, to sniff packets on the "eth0" interface, you would run the following command:

python sniff.py eth0

The script will then print information about each packet that it receives. This information includes the packet type, length, source and destination addresses, and protocol.
